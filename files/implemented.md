□ = documented  
✓ = implemented

if only N exists, it's if it's implemented at all  
if 3 columns exist, it's a monadic function  
if 6 columns exist, it's a dyadic+ function (higher adicies are complicated)  
if 5 columns exist, it's a loop(ish thing) starter they correspond to `NSA｝］` where NSA are what types it works for and brackets - for what bracket types it works for

### palindromizator defs

- Hx = horizontal palindromization with x overlap  
  - mH = mirror horizontal - the reverse part gets characters swapped  
  - Hr = overlap = remainder  
- Vx = vertical palindromization with x overlap  
  - mV = mirror vertical - the reverse part gets mirrored vertically  
  - sV = smart vertical - mV, but underscores get moved around to look better  
  - Vr = overlap = remainder  
- xO = overlap mode  
  - bO = basic overlap - simpleOverlap (aka just choose the 2nd)  
  - gO = background overlap - noBGOverlap (aka basic overlap, but spaces get deprioritized)  
  - sO = smart overlap - smartOverlap (aka overlap smartly (e.g. \ + / -> X))
